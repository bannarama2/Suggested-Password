## Random Password Generator

This is a Python script that generates strong and random passwords, similar to the password suggestions provided by services like Google. The script utilizes the `random` library to create passwords with a diverse mix of characters for enhanced security.

### How It Works

The password generator operates based on the following principles:

1. **Character Lists**: Four lists are defined for numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and symbols.

2. **Random Selection**: The script uses random number generation to select which character list to draw from.

3. **Character Selection**: Once a list is chosen, a random index is selected from that list to pick a character.

4. **Password Length**: The user is prompted to specify the desired length of the password. The script then generates a password of that length using a loop.

### Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.

2. Enter the desired length of the password when prompted.

3. The script will generate a random password with a mix of numbers, letters (both uppercase and lowercase), and symbols.

### Example

Suppose you want to create a random password of length 12. You would run the script, input `12`, and it would generate a password like: `A9$bRcPq5&2X`.

Feel free to customize and integrate this password generator into your projects or use it to generate secure passwords for various accounts.
